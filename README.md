# Data extraction templates for pfSense

pfSense is an open-source firewall and router platform based on FreeBSD, designed for flexibility, security, and ease of use. It provides powerful features such as VPN, load balancing, and traffic shaping, often found in commercial firewalls.

Sadly most SIEM solutions (even open source ones) would not read the Syslog messages send by pfSense out of the box.

This repository show some solutions for some SIEMs from my Homelab. 

I add content as I find time to play with other tools in my lab...

Please consider all here as "work in progress" or "proof of concet"!
